## Hey! Glad to see you here =)

I'm a backend software engineer who's absolutely fascinated by the inner workings of computers and Linux systems.

Currently, I'm focused on observability/monitoring for applications and Linux infraestructure, performance testing, developing and maintaning REST and WebSockets APIs, and working with relational databases.

When I'm not working, I love watching crime and thriller shows. I was recently hooked on _CSI: Vegas_ after stopping at season 9, and now I'm enjoying the most recent _Dexter_ show. I'm also a huge fan of horror movies! There was a time that I watched the _Scream_ franchise every day for months. Even now, when I'm in the mood, I'll still put them on. While I love cheesy horror movies from the 2000s, I have to admit I'm an even bigger fan of the ones from the 70s and 90s.
