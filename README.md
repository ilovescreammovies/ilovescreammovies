## Hey! Glad to see you here =)

I'm a backend software engineer, and I'm absolutely fascinated by the inner workings of computers and Linux systems.

When I'm not working, I really enjoy watching crime and thriller shows. Just a few days ago, I was totally hooked on watching CSI: Vegas. I stopped watching it after season 9, and now I'm enjoying Dexter's most recent shows. I'm also a big fan of horror movies! There was a time when I was in such a deep state of nostalgia that I watched the Scream franchise movies every day for several months. And even now, when I'm feeling nostalgic, I still watch them. I'm also a big fan of cheesy horror movies from the 2000s, but I have to say, I'm even more of an enthusiast for the ones from the 70s and 90s.

Right now, I'm doing things related to applications and Linux infrastructure observability/monitoring, performance testing, REST and WebSockets API development and maintenance, and relational databases.
